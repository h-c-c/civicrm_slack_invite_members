This is a module for CiviCRM that invites new CiviMembers to your organizations Slack channels automatically when they join.  It will not invite existing CiviMembers.  

It is not by any means friendly to use as it's not an extension with a configuration page.  To work, it requires hand editing and a little sleuthing to discover the relevant Slack channel ids.
